# Patent Classifications and Keywords Used to Define AI Patent Universe

The following table lists the Cooperative Patent Classifications (CPCs) used to define the AI patent data universe. Note that classifications in bold type were also searched using International Patent Classifications (IPCs). The CPC system is much more detailed than the IPC, so many specific CPCs have no equivalent IPC. The overall search strategy is Patent Classification **OR** Keyword (see list below).
